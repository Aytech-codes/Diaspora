      <h2>About Us</h2>
   <p class="about-text">
    At Diaspora Families Support, we seek to provide backing for people in Diaspora — all those who have arrived in Scotland from other nations, for whatever purpose. This includes enabling a smooth transition, educating, equipping, and resourcing newcomers as they navigate the challenges of entering a new culture.
  </p>
  <p class="about-text">
    In this site people from different cultures can read and learn about others. Such cultural activities may include (but are not limited to) food, dress, principles, sayings, ideas, rules, regulations, values, norms, and more. The list is endless.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a site for people who are married across nations and continents to interact and get to understand the cultures of their partners. They are welcome to ask questions and find answers to their enquiries. This site is child friendly because we listen to both adults and children, encouraging everyone to express their views in a constructive and respectful manner.
  </p>
  <p class="about-text">
    As this group develops, people from various backgrounds will raise issues for others to discuss and contribute towards. We invite you to interact, leave comments, or offer suggestions. We will highlight topics and areas for discussion as frequently as possible.

                This forum is a space for couples to be enriched and supported as they find their way around their new neighbourhood. 
                Sometimes couples are not aware of the impact of changes in their relationships. This has led to long term challenges. 
                In some cases, it has led to break ups. We seek to mitigate these challenges and we offer the right support right from their entry into their new culture.

                People seem to be making progress in life as they go about their businesses. And so, life continues, and everyone minds their own business. 
                The world is growing apart at a fast rate. This may be called individualism or maintaining individual space. 
                We seem to mind our individual business, let people go on with their life as we take care of ours. But is that real? 
                Is it true that what others do are none of our concern? Where is such mindset taking us?
